# Java SE Application  
This directory contains a basic Java SE application focusing on object-oriented programming, Stream API, and concurrency. The key components include:  
- Implementation of entity classes with relationships.  
- Object creation using the builder pattern.  
- Stream API operations for filtering, sorting, and transforming collections.  
- Serialization and deserialization of data to binary files.  
- Concurrent execution using custom thread pools and parallel Stream API.  

**How to Launch:**
Run the main Java class in the `src/main/java` directory.
