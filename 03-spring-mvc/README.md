# Spring MVC Application  
This directory extends the Spring Boot application with RESTful services using Spring MVC. The main components are:  
- REST controllers for handling CRUD operations.  
- DTO classes for request and response models.  
- Well-structured API endpoints with proper HTTP methods and response codes.  
- HTTP request documentation for API testing.  


**How to Launch:**
Start the Spring Boot application and use `cityRequests.http` and `countryRequests.http` for API testing.
