# Microservices Architecture  
This directory decomposes the monolithic application into separate microservices for categories and elements. Key features include:  
- Independent Spring Boot services for category and element management.  
- REST-based inter-service communication.  
- Spring Cloud Gateway for API routing.  
- Event-driven communication for synchronization.  

**How to Launch:**
Start each Spring Boot service separately.
