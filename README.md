# Microservices Development Lab  

This repository contains a series of evolving microservices applications, covering **Java SE, Spring Boot, Angular, Docker, and cloud-based deployment**. Each stage builds on the previous one, introducing new technologies and concepts for **backend, frontend, containerization, and service orchestration**.  

## Repository Structure  

Each folder represents a separate phase of the project:  

- **`01-java-se/`** – Java SE application with object-oriented principles, Stream API, serialization, and concurrency.  
- **`02-spring-core/`** – Spring Boot application with JPA, dependency injection, and database integration using Spring Data.  
- **`03-spring-mvc/`** – REST API development using Spring MVC with DTOs and HTTP request handling.  
- **`04-microservices/`** – Monolithic app split into microservices with inter-service communication.  
- **`05-angular/`** – Angular frontend consuming microservices with routing, forms, and API integration.  
- **`06-docker/`** – Containerization of services using Docker and Docker Compose for deployment.  
- **`07-deployment/`** – Advanced deployment with service discovery, centralized configuration, and cloud-based orchestration.  

For more details check **README.md** in specific directories.
